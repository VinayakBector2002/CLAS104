        <h2 class="title">Theban Saga</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of the course, we discussed three classes of myth: <strong>myth</strong> dealing primarily with the gods, <strong>saga</strong> focusing on the actions of mortal (often semi-divine) heroes, and <strong>folktale</strong>. It will be clear already from our examination of the myths about the gods that these categories overlap a great deal – myths about the gods do not deal only with the gods, nor do sagas involving particular heroes avoid the gods or elements of folktale. Saga, as we will see, often has some historical connection to geographical areas important in the late Bronze Age, and it is notable that there are cycles of myths that all focus on the same area or family. We will therefore first be dividing our study of saga into broad geographical groups, focusing on Thebes and the Mycenae. </p>
       <p> These sagas contain a great number of characters and can quickly become overwhelming in a course that focuses on more than just one set of myths. The following therefore provides a distillation of what you will find in the textbook on the Theban saga and is intended to indicate the focus of what you should know about this saga. This should help you organize your thoughts as you read through the primary sources and descriptions in the textbook.</p>
