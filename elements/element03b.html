     <h2 class="title">The Creation of Mankind&mdash;Hesiod's Five Ages</h2>
<p>Let's now consider the creation of humankind, as presented by Hesiod. We have just seen that one of the characteristics of Zeus is his cleverness. Cleverness is once again an important theme in the creation of mankind. The actual creation of mankind is not told by Hesiod in his <em>Theogony</em>, but it is recounted in the second of his famous poems, the <em>Works and Days</em>. What kind of poem is the <em>Works and Days</em>? It is the same as the <em>Theogony</em> in form; it is written in hexameter verse. However, in content matter, the poem is not theogonic; rather, it falls into a tradition of what might be called &lsquo;Wisdom Literature&rsquo;. That is to say it is a work of instruction which gives humanity advice about how to farm, and generally how to live one&rsquo;s life. At the end of the poem, Hesiod gives advice on the right time to sail, when to get married, how to treat friendships, behaviour at parties, when to urinate and copulate, etc. We hear such advice as the following, 'And do not ever pour a libation of gleaming wine at dawn to Zeus or the other immortals with unwashed hands; for they do not listen, but spurn the prayers. And do not urinate standing up facing the sun; but be mindful to do so after it sets, and before it rises, but even so do not completely bare yourself: for the nights belong to the blessed ones. And do not urinate while you are walking, on the road or off the road: it is crouching that the god-fearing man, who knows wisdom, does it, or after he has approached towards the wall of a well-fenced courtyard. And inside the house do not reveal your genitals besmirched with intercourse near the hearth, but avoid this.&rsquo; Alongside such practical religious advice, one is counselled on moral matters: consider, 'Avoid the wretched talk of mortals. For talk is evil: it is light to raise up quite easily, but it is difficult to bear, and hard to put down. No talk is ever entirely gotten rid of, once many people talk it up: it too is some god.'<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a>           </p><p>Such advice is not mythology, but nor is the <em>Works and Days</em> entirely a handbook of practical advice about how to conduct one&rsquo;s life. In another way, one can see the <em>Works and Days</em> as a counterpart to the <em>Theogony</em> in that the latter is a poem focused on the gods and their genesis, the <em>Works and Days</em> is a poem which focuses on humanity, its origins and its way of life. We do find mythology within the <em>Works and Days </em>and it is here that we find the myth of the five different ages of humanity. In some other accounts, such as that by Ovid there are only four ages of mankind, but Hesiod includes five ages. These ages are the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age (not to be confused with the historical bronze age), the Age of Heroes, and the Iron Age (excerpts from Hesiod's description of the five ages are found in the textbook). The first age is one of plenty and long age, in which man is very close to the gods. Kronos is said to create this race of mankind, who lived in his time. One can compare, for example, the account of the Garden of Eden in Genesis. As the ages proceed, mankind falls into an ever greater state of lawlessness and suffering. The Silver Age, created by the gods on Olympus is still quite pleasant, but noticeably below the quality of the Golden Age. The Bronze Age, created by Zeus, is again worse. Only the Age of Heroes which seems to have been inserted specifically by Hesiod, interrupts the otherwise steady decline. The heroes created by Zeus, who include the heroes of the Trojan war, receive a special fate and are closely linked to the divine. But by the time we reach the fifth of Hesiod's ages which corresponds with his own, mankind has descended into a miserable state of war and corruption. The yearning for a better time in which humanity previously dwelt closely with the gods can be paralleled in many different traditions.</p>
