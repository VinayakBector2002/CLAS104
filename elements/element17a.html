        <h2 class="title">Odysseus and Nostoi</h2>
        <p>Following the Trojan war, the victorious Greeks needed to return from the coast of Asia Minor to their homes around the Greek Aegean. These returns, known in Greek as &lsquo;Nostoi&rsquo;, were important enough within early Greek mythology to be narrated in an epic poem dedicated to the topic (called the <em>Nostoi</em>–this poem has not survived, although we do have a prose summary of its contents). Many of the returns of the Greek leaders were disastrous, involving shipwreck, death (we can think here of Agamemnon), or expulsion from their homes when they eventually arrive. Several of the heroes (such as Diomedes, Idomeneus, and Philoctetes) end up leaving Greece and settling ultimately in Italy which seems to reflect within mythology the foundation of Greek colonies in the archaic period. It is unsurprising, perhaps, that these journeys involve danger. Sea travel was an inherently dangerous and yet present method of mobility for the Greeks and Romans living in the Aegean (short summaries of some of the major <em>Nostoi </em>narratives are found in M&amp;L 523–4).</p>
        <p> The most extensive and well known narrative of a return journey of one of the Greek heroes is that of Odysseus which was narrated in the long epic poem the <em>Odyssey</em>. This poem is in the same dialect as the <em>Iliad </em>and said in antiquity to be also by Homer. Odysseus&rsquo; journey home is a fantastic one, involving romance and many elements of folktale. We see many of the same motifs in the Odyssey narrative as in other accounts of nostoi, such as shipwreck and fantastic adventure, but on a much greater scale.</p>
        <p> Odysseus must endure many hardships and adventures before he returns home. He wanders a full ten years after the Trojan war. The god Poseidon is hostile to Odysseus and often causes him to suffer and be taken off course. At his home in Ithaca, suitors of Penelope, who think him dead, try to convince his wife Penelope to marry them. She remains faithful, but they waste away his property with their feasting and celebrations. His son Telemachus, once he has reached adolescence goes in search of him. The narrative of Homer&rsquo;s <em>Odyssey</em> (divided into 24 books corresponding to the letters of the Greek alphabet, as the <em>Iliad</em>)can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p>Books 1-4: Telemachus goes in search of his father. He visits Menelaus in Sparta.</p>
        <p>Books 5-8: Odysseus is released by the nymph Calypso, who has harboured him on her island as her lover. He has at this point already completed many of his adventures, but we hear about these later. She has offered Odysseus immortality and a life of pleasure with her, but he longs to return home to his wife. He sails on a raft, but a storm destroys the raft and he lands on Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians. Nausicaa falls in love with him and takes him to her father and mother, Alcinous and Arete. He is treated kindly.</p>
        <p>Books 9-13: at a great feast held by Alcinous in Odysseus&rsquo; honour, Odysseus recounts all of his adventures up until this point. The next day the Phaeacians return him to Ithaca. Poseidon punishes them on their return by turning them to stone.</p>
        <p>Books 14-24: Odysseus is reunited with his son and his trusted swineherd Eumaeus, at first in disguise before he reveals himself. He plans to go to the palace disguised as a beggar, where he tests the fidelity of Penelope and plots against the suitors. He eventually reveals himself to Penelope, kills the suitors, and reunites with his wife and family.</p>
        <p>Odysseus&rsquo; journey, as indicated above, is a long one fraught with many dangers. The geography of his journey does not correspond exactly to locations in the Aegean—nonetheless, it is possible to suggest a general route which the story of the journey may have inspired in the minds of ancient audiences. Odysseus travels from Asia Minor, to Africa, Italy, and as far as the Straits of Gibraltar (we will see many overlaps between his journey and the later journeys of Heracles and Jason). </p>
