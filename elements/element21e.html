        <h2 class="title">Betrayal and Murder of Children</h2>
        <p>According to Euripides’ fifth-century B.C.E. tragedy <em>Medea</em> (the most influential ancient account of the myth), when Jason and Medea arrive in Corinth, Jason divorces Medea to marry Glauce (also named Creusa), the daughter of Creon, the king of Corinth. This naturally infuriates Medea, who c<a rel="example_group" title="Ixioin Painter, c. 340-320 B.C.E.. Musee du Louvre, Paris, France. Erich Lessing and Fine Arts Archives / ARTS RESOURCE, N.Y.." a href="../images/module21/large/Image3.jpg"><img src="../images/module21/thumbs/image3_mod21.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="90" class="alignleft" /></a>ontrives to kill Glauce. She sends her a gift of a poisoned robe and crown which burn both Glauce and Creon. She then, in a terrifying move, kills her own children in revenge against Jason. <strong>(see image 1)</strong> Medea then flees to Athens, where she marries king Aegeus (where we encountered her in the myth of Theseus).</p>
        <p> An earlier version of the myth of Jason and Medea recounted that their children were killed accidentally, when Medea concealed them in a sanctuary of Hera in the hopes of making the immortal. Euripides, however, in presenting on the Athenian stage Medea’s horrifying intentional killing of her children, problematizes questions of guilt and heroism. On the one hand, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to understand how a mother could kill her own children in order to exact revenge. On the other, Medea is a terribly wronged woman, who through love helped Jason, betrayed her family, and left her homeland to live as a foreigner. Jason himself is not always presented as a strong and effective hero: in the Latin poet Ovid he is a competent hero, but in the earlier account of Apollonius of Rhodes in the third century Jason is ambiguously heroic (very different, for example, that Odysseus). Frequently throughout his journey, he himself achieves little without the help of others, especially Medea. His treatment of Medea upon their return home further calls into question his heroism and character. Culpability and blame are not easily assigned in Euripides’ famous account of this tragic and moving affair.</p>
