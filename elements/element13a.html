        <h2 class="title">Visions of Death&mdash;The Underworld in Classical Mythology</h2>
        <p>In this module we are going to examine the Greek and Roman understanding of death and the underworld. We have already had occasion to encounter the underworld when looking at the myths of Demeter, Persephone and Hermes, all gods who have a connection with both fertility and the world of the dead. A consideration of death, or rather what happens after death, is, as one might expect, central to any reading of Classical mythology which is not only marvellous literature, but religious literature. And death is of course a universal concern for humanity; around the world different cultures and religions contemplate our existence, and try to make sense of both our place in the world and our deaths. Mortality, although it is not something which we often like to think about in our younger years, is a fact which we must all face, and although we no longer follow the religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks and Romans, their exploration of mortality can be emotionally powerful for us. The Christian poet Dante, for example, whose <em>Inferno</em> provides a powerful description of Christian hell, was highly inspired by the Latin poet Virgil and his description of the underworld, just as was Milton in his <em>Paradise Lost</em>. As always, Classical literature has inspired poets throughout the ages.</p>
        <p> We have already seen on several different occasions that the most common name for the underworld was Hades, a personified god and brother of Zeus, but also a place to which the souls of departed mortals go. Hades is in fact far more commonly mentioned as the underworld than as a personified god in Classical literature, although we do see him as an actual character in some myths, most famously in the story of the abduction of Persesphone which we encountered in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>. In post-classical times, the term Hades was adopted by Christian authors, including the early Church Fathers, Dante and Milton, to refer to the Christian concept of Hell. The term used is the same, but it is important to distinguish between the Christian conception of Hell and Hades. For Christians, Hell, a place under the earth, is a place to which the souls of the wicked descend after death, whereas the souls of the good are taken up to heaven. The ancient Greek concept is extremely different. We cannot understand the ancient Greek gods as moral beings in the same way that many monotheistic religions consider God to be a moral power. A similar principle is true of the Greek conception of the underworld; in Classical mythology, it is not just the souls of the wicked who descend to Hades after death, but rather the souls of all mortal men, good or bad. As we will see, men and women from the most heroic to the least are to be found in Hades after their life has come to an end. In contrast, the heavens are where the gods live, and only the most select of mortals are able to gain a place in heaven, in which case they are divinized, made immortal, rather than dead; Heracles, whom we will look at more in a subsequent week, is an example of a great hero, the semi-divine son of Zeus, who is actually granted immortality. Other heroes, however, such as Achilles must die and descend to Hades. In some versions of Classical myths, heroes did achieve a divine status apart from the gods and were considered to be in an intermediary position between the gods and average mortals in Hades; most notably, Hesiod describes a special existence for heroes on the Isle of the Blessed in his myth of the five generations of men which we looked at when we examined the creation of men. Usually, however, the heroes of ancient Greece are also found in the underworld, along with the rest of humankind.</p>
        <p> To say, however, that as a general rule the Classical underworld is a place for all humankind, regardless of what one has done in his or her life, is to simplify a complex concept. As we will see in the description of the underworld given by the Latin poet Virgil, there is a clear idea that different fates await those who descend to the afterlife in Hades. The very depths of the underworld, known as Tartarus, could be considered a parallel to our Hell, where those who displeased the gods were sentenced to some terrible punishments. Conversely, those people who distinguished themselves in the eyes of the gods existed in a part of the underworld known as Elysium, an equivalent perhaps to our Heaven. It is here that Vergil pictures heroes and the great men of Greece and Rome after they die.
