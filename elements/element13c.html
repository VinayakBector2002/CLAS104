        <h2 class="title">The Afterlife According to Plato</h2>
        <p>Moving briefly away from the early conception of death in Homer, it is essential to bear in mind that the Greeks and Romans did not always view the afterlife in this way. We find, for example, a very different view of the afterlife by the famous fourth-century Greek philosopher Plato, who himself draws on earlier philosophical conceptions of existence. Plato did not accept the religious view presented in the myths we have been reading, but nor did he entirely abandon it. Plato moves away from the conceptions of the Homeric gods which included corporality and destruction, to understand instead a &lsquo;real&rsquo; world which was other, incorporeal and always existing. For Plato there is a world beyond what we see and know in this life which is in itself an illusory reality. Plato places a great deal of emphasis on the soul (<em>psyche</em> in Greek) which became extremely important in Plato&rsquo;s vision of the world. The soul of a human was separate from his body and returned to true existence after death. Death is for Plato true only of the body, not the soul. Yet Plato still uses myth to explain his conception of death: his unique <em>Myth of Er </em>told at the end of the tenth book of his <em>Republic</em> (see M&amp;L 361–7). A mortal man Er dies, but returns to life to recount his experience of what happens to souls after death. The full myth of Er is complicated and involves a detailed description of the cosmos, of which Plato understands the centre to be the earth. Important for our purposes, however, is that Plato envisions different outcomes for the souls of men, depending upon how they acted in life. Plato believes in reincarnation, a cycle which can only be broken (so Plato tells us in his work the <em>Phaedo</em>) by true philosophers, who through virtue eventually live entirely as souls in peace in the afterlife. You will notice immediately the difference between this conception of death (and rebirth) and the myth of Odysseus&rsquo; descent into the underworld. For Plato, virtue in life is significant for one&rsquo;s lot in the afterlife.</p>
