     <h2 class="title">Interpretative Theories</h2>
<p>It is perhaps in part the great complexity and multiplicity of the stories of classical mythology which have allowed them to touch the imagination of not only the Greeks and Romans themselves, but countless numbers of people up until the present day. References to classical mythology can be found everywhere in the corpus of Western literature, music, opera, art, sport and even commercial advertising — and Classical mythology has been interpreted and used by people in many different ways. I am now going to outline some (by no means all) of the most important scholarly methods used for the interpretation of mythology. It is imperative from the outset to stress that THERE IS NO ONE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF A MYTH. As is the case with much of literature and art, it is possible for one myth to have different meanings for different people, and to serve different functions in different contexts. For myself, I have always viewed mythology not necessarily as providing particular ANSWERS about many of the deeper questions of life and existence, but as provoking QUESTIONS about these things. Mythology is for me a medium of exploration.</p>
           <p>That said, one of the ways in which mythology has been interpreted historically is as etiological stories; that is, from the Greek word 'aitia' (αἰτία) which means 'cause'. According to this approach mythology explains the causes or origins of certain things which cannot be explained in other ways. An example of this would be the story that is found in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter which we will read in this course. In this poem, the goddess Demeter, who is in search of her abducted daughter Persephone, is described founding the religious cult of Demeter at <a id="various3" href="https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Eleusis&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Eleusina,+West+Attica,+Greece&amp;gl=ca&amp;t=m&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed">Eleusis</a> in Greece. This was an actual religious cult site in Greece, and therefore the hymn can be seen in part as an explanation for the foundation of the cult. Elsewhere, one could say that the myths of the creation of the world found in Hesiod, explain the origins of existence. Such a theory cannot, however, be applied to all myths; the stories of the many great deeds which Heracles performed cannot, for example, easily be classified as etiological.</p>
          
             <p>Others have tried to explain mythology as allegorical or symbolic, meaning that what one encounters in mythology is representative of aspects of human nature and other universal truths. This can again be a very useful way to approach mythology; one might, for example, say that the disguise which Aphrodite uses in order to fool Anchises into thinking she is a mortal woman (as told in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite) is representative of a certain deceitful side of erotic love. Some people have, however, carried allegorical and symbolic interpretation too far, in particular Max Müller and others, who proposed that all myths were allegories of natural and cosmological phenomena. This can be applicable in certain circumstances (certain myths can explain the movement of the sun, or the establishment of certain constellations in the sky), but such an approach cannot explain the majority of what one encounters in Classical mythology.</p>
             <p>One particularly important approach to mythology came with the advent of psychoanalysis, developed by Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and others. In their studies of the human unconscious Freud and Jung drew a connection between mythology and the deepest of humans wants and desires. Freud in fact directly connected one of his most famous principles, the Oedipus Complex, with Classical mythology; Freud believed that the desire of a boy to sleep with his mother, or a girl to sleep with her father (which Jung coined the Electra complex), is a repressed desire of humanity in childhood. In the classical myth, Oedipus unwittingly sleeps with his own mother and kills his father; Freud saw this as representative of our own first desires and impulses. This approach of Freud, as one might expect, has been extremely controversial. Many have continued to deny that his theories about these unconscious sexual desires are correct; some anthropologists have claimed that incest is in fact programmed against in our genetics, and that Freud's theories of repressed desire for incest cannot be correct. This may very well be true, but the importance of Freud's theories cannot be denied. Freud went much farther than suggesting simply that myth could be representative of a desire for incest; he connected mythology more generally with dreams and the human unconscious. Freud believed that dreams worked through the fulfilment of wishes and desires which are repressed in conscious life; a person in his or her dreams condenses or abbreviates elements of wishes and desires, displaces them by giving them different emphasis, and represents them as symbols and imagery. Myth, as well as any artistic production, shares many elements of this process, and Freud therefore saw myth as a waking attempt to understand and explain the impulses of the dream world. Carl Jung carried Freud's theories even farther, suggesting that myths are a projection of the 'collective unconsciousness' of humanity. That is to say that, as myths developed, they became representative of the common unconscious tendencies and desires of the human race. In doing this, Jung drew a distinction between one's individual unconscious and the collective concerns of humanity. He still connects myth to the unconscious, but suggests that images in myths are 'archetypes' of behaviour. In other words, the stories of mythology provide models which teach us how to behave and how to interact with our world.  As with all of the other ways of approaching mythology, these theories cannot necessarily be applied universally, although they have come far closer than some. Again, it is not necessary to look to one theory alone to explain the purpose of mythology.</p>
             <p>One of the major criticisms of the work of Freud and Jung is that their psychoanalytic approach to myth is too generalized and does not account for the differences which one finds in the myths of distinct cultures around the world. At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, there was a movement which increasingly saw myth as inseparable from the society in which it developed. J.G. Frazer and others following him drew a particular link between myth and religious ritual, although their theories were problematic, once again due to a certain absolute insistence that myth is always connected to and enacting ritual. A similar approach to myth has been taken by Robert Graves, who as a well-known author has done much to popularise the study of ancient mythology. </p>
               <p>Of particular importance for the development of theories which admitted a connection between myth and society, was the work of the Polish anthropologist Bronislav Malinowski. He felt that it was important to live within and study a culture, in order to understand its point of view and vision of the world, and this was significant also for understanding the myths of a culture. He tried to explain myths as stories which reflected social customs and beliefs.</p>
                 <p>Such a connection between myth and society is also what is behind the very famous structuralist approach to myth, for which the French scholar Claude Lévi-Strauss is most famous. Strauss argued that social interactions are fundamental to the organisation of a culture and represent a structure which appears as binary opposites – one of his most famous examples of this principle is that what is raw is the binary opposite of what is cooked; again, for him such oppositions give the basic structure for the expression of ideas and thoughts of a culture. Strauss applied this principle also to myth. He saw myth as a way in which people are able to communicate, by mediating structural binary opposites. That is to say that, beyond the individual narrative details of a given myth, one can see underlying structural oppositions in myths of all cultures, such as the interaction of men and women. This approach to mythology can be useful; we will see when we come to the creation myths of Hesiod, for example, one can identify a number of binary opposites, such as that between male and female in the development of the gods. Again, however, this extremely analytical approach to myth has its limitation, particularly in that it assumes too rigid and universal a model of human thought across cultures.</p>
                   <p>In one sense then, Strauss' theory of structuralism which continues to be used, developed and debated, although it is founded in a basic understanding of cultural communication, moves away from the work of people like Branislov Malinowski, who saw myth as founded in the cultural and historical concept of a particular society. More moderate positions have since been taken by people like Walter Burkert, the very famous contemporary scholar of Greek religion, who sees structuralist approaches to myth as useful if they are grounded in an understanding of the particular culture. In other words, myth cannot be separated from its historical context. One may find structural sequences within traditional stories which are similar across cultures, but a myth is nonetheless a tale that is developed and put to use within a particular culture. The approach of Burkert to myth is attractive in its inclusiveness. It recognises universal truths in myth and accepts the application of the interpretative theories outlines above, such structuralism and psychology. At the same time, it grounds such approaches in the historical and religious context of a society. </p>
                   <p>In this course, we will follow the inclusive approach of scholars such as Walter Burkert. We will consider carefully how the myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans can be interpreted within their own cultural and historical context, while also exploring how the significance of Greek and Roman mythology transcends cultural and temporal boundaries. Next, we will look in overview at Greek and Roman history and religious beliefs, in order to set the stage for our subsequent study of Classical mythology.</p>
