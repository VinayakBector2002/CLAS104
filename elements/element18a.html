        <h2 class="essential_element">Essential Element:  Part I</h2>
    
      <div class="content">
        <h2 class="title">Perseus</h2>
        <p>The mythological founder of the city Argos is Phoroneus. The goddess Hera was worshipped prominently in Argos. In mythology she was said to have taken control of the land in a contest with Poseidon. Phoroneus was asked to judge who should have it, and he decided in Hera&rsquo;s favour. Poseidon dried up the Argive rivers in revenge, one of which was Inachus, the father of Phoroneus as well as Io, a woman with whom Zeus had an affair. Several generations after Phoroneus, Danae gives birth to Perseus. Danae is the child of Acrisius, the king of Argos, who locked his daughter away in a room after an oracle pronounced that her son would kill him. As we have seen already at the beginning of the course, Zeus visits her as a shower of gold and impregnates her, in one of his many affairs with mortals. The child Perseus was born and kept secret in the room for four years, until Acrisius discovered him and set him and his mother afloat on the sea in a chest.  They floated to the island of Seriphos, where a fisherman named Dictys (which in Greek means &lsquo;net&rsquo;) rescued them and gave them shelter.</p>
        <p> The brother of Dictys was Polydectes, the king of <a id="various3" a href="https://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Seriphos+island+greece&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.154365,24.501743&amp;sspn=0.050485,0.081711&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=N%C3%ADsos+S%C3%A9rifos&amp;t=m&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed">Seriphos</a>. Polydectes fell in love with Danae, but she would not have him. One day Polydectes invited the men of Seriphos to a banquet, at which they all had to present him with a gift. Perseus boasted that he could give him a Gorgon&rsquo;s head and Polydectes sends him away on this journey. The Gorgons were three monstrous sisters with snakes for hair, whose look turned men to stone. Two of the Gorgons were immortal, but a third, Medusa, could be slain. It is therefore the famous Medusa whom Perseus goes to kill.</p>
        <p> Perseus is helped by both Hermes and Athena. They tell him first to go to the three daughters of Phorcys, the sisters of the Gorgons. These are old women called the Graeae (which means &lsquo;old women&rsquo; in Greek), who were old from their birth. They tell him how to find the nymphs who would be able to give him magical items he would need for his journey. He gets the information from them by taking their eye and their tooth (they had one of each between them to share) and not giving it back until they told him what he wanted. We can note here that Perseus receives divine and semi-divine help on his quest, comparable in respects to the help and information that Odysseus receives on his long journey home (Odysseus is, for example, helped by both Hermes and Athena). He eventually receives a number of magical items:</p>
        <p><strong>From the Nymphs</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cap of Invisibility</li>
          <li> Winged Sandals</li>
          <li>Pouch (in Greek called a &lsquo;kibisis&rsquo;)</li>
        </ul>
<p><strong>From Hermes</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scimitar</li>
        </ul>
