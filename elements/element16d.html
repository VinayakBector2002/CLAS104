        <h2 class="title">The War in the <em>Illiad</em></h2>
        <p>Once Helen has been abducted, Agamemnon and Menelaus assemble the Greek army at the bay of Aulis, in order to set off to Troy to regain Helen (as we have previously explored in looking at the Mycenaean saga). The <em>Iliad</em> itself begins its narrative in the tenth year of the war and narrates the events leading to the capture of Troy (although not the capture itself &mdash; we hear of this in other sources, but not the <em>Iliad </em>itself). A useful summary of the <em>Iliad</em>, a poem of almost 16,000 lines can be found here: <a href="https://www.reed.edu/humanities/hum110/iliad.html" title="Plot Outline for Homer's Iliad" target="_blank">Plot Outline for Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and List of Principal Characters.</a></p>
        <p> The actual end to the Trojan war is recorded in accounts by later Greek and Roman authors, and in summaries of other, now lost, early epic poems about the war at Troy. After the funeral of Hector, the battle at Troy continues, and is not decided until the Greeks trick the Trojans into taking the now famous Trojan horse into the city. But before the city is actually taken, Achilles is killed pursing the Trojans. He is killed by Paris, who shoots him in the ankle with the help of the archer god Apollo, who is on the side of the Trojans. Achilles is a semi-divine hero, born of Thetis, a sea nymph, and Peleus a mortal. Thetis had tried to make Achilles fully immortal, either by holding him over a fire at night and anointing him with ambrosia (the food of the gods and an unguent) or by dipping him in the water of the river Styx. All of Achilles that was submerged was made immortal, but the spot where Thetis held Achilles, his ankle, remained vulnerable. Hence the modern expression &lsquo;Achilles&rsquo; heel&rsquo; to refer to a person&rsquo;s weak spot. </p>
        <p> Of particular importance for the story of Troy is the fate of Achilles&rsquo; &mdash; it is his anger which is the driving theme of the <em>Iliad</em>. But just as Achilles is important for Troy, Troy is important for Achilles. After his birth, his mother Thetis learned that her son had two possible fates in front of him. If he stayed home from Troy, he would live a long but inglorious life. On the other hand, if he went to Troy he would die young but would die a glorious hero. One story has Thetis try to prevent Achilles going to Troy, by dressing him up as a girl and taking him to the island of Scyros, where he was raised with the daughters of Lycomedes, the king of the island. However, the Greek heroes Odysseus and Diomedes discovered the plot to hide him by bringing gifts to the daughters of Lycomedes. Amongst the gifts they brought armour, in which Achilles showed interest, and which he eventually put on when a trumpet sounded announcing battle &mdash; all of the women actually ran away.</p>
        <p> One of the qualities of Troy is that it was a well-fortified city with high walls. Throughout the <em>Iliad</em>, the Trojan king Priam is able to observe the war from the safety of his walls. In order to defeat the Trojans, the Greeks had to find a way to enter the walls. Very famously, they trick the Trojans with the wooden horse. Epeus, one of the Greeks, built (with the help of Athena) a great hollow wooden horse, in which the greatest of the Greek heroes hid themselves. This story is not told in the <em>Iliad</em>, but is known in the <em>Odyssey</em> and in later accounts of the Trojan war. In the end, through all the brute force of war, it was cunning which won the day. The Greeks left the horse outside the walls of Troy, while the other Greeks sailed away, giving the impression that they had given up the war. In a version of the story told by Virgil in his <em>Aineid</em>, one Greek named Sinon was left behind. He lied to the Trojans, pretending to be an enemy of Odysseus, saying that the horse was an offering to Athena which if brought inside the walls of Troy would protect it from harm.</p>
           <h2 class="essential_element">Principal Characters</h2>
        <p>The saga of the Trojan war has many characters, and you are not expected to memorize all of them. Below is a list of principal characters involved in the myth, with whom you should be familiar. Many of these we have encountered in other myths, but some will be new to you. More information on these characters is also to be found in M&amp;L chapter 19:</p>
    
        <p><strong>Agamemnon</strong>&mdash;Leader of the Greeks and a great warrior.<u></u></p>
        <p><strong>Menelaus</strong>&mdash;King of Sparta and the husband of Helen.</p>
        <p><strong>Diomedes</strong>&mdash;King of Argos and a great warrior of the Greek army. He is also a wise counselor. </p>
        <p><strong>Nestor</strong>&mdash;King of Pylos. During the time of the Trojan war he is an old man, but he was once a great warrior. He is the wisest Greek leader at Troy.</p>
        <p><strong>Ajax the Great, son of Telamon</strong>&mdash; Ajax the Great is the son of Telamon. He is a strong warrior, known more for his brawn than his brains.</p>
        <p><strong>Ajax the Less</strong>&mdash; Ajax the Less is the son of Oileus. A less distinguished warrior than Ajax. He is best known for dragging Priam&rsquo;s daughter from the temple of Athena where she had taken refuge during the sack of Troy.</p>
        <p><strong>Odysseus</strong>&mdash;King of Ithaca, known as a great warrior but most prominently as a very clever and tricky individual. Not wanting to go to war in the first place, he pretended to be mad, but was discovered, when the hero Palamedes took Odysseus&rsquo; son Telemachus and put him in the path of his plow; Odysseus did not, of course, run him over, showing that he was sane.</p>
        <p><strong>Achilles</strong>&mdash;The great hero of Greeks and the leader of the Myrmidons, son of Thetis and Peleus.</p>
        <p><strong>Patroclus</strong>&mdash;Also a great warrior. When young, he had killed a man during a game of dice and Achilles father took him in to be Achilles&rsquo; companion; they are perhaps lovers and Patroclus is important for the story of the Trojan War. <br />
          <strong>Priam and Hecuba</strong>&mdash;King and Queen of Troy. Priam is said to have had 50 sons and 12 daughters, 19 of which he had with Hecuba. At the time of the Trojan war they are older parents.</p>
        <p><strong>Paris (Alexander)</strong>&mdash;Son of Priam and Hecuba. A pretty boy, patronized by Aphrodite.</p>
        <p><strong>Hector, Andromache and Astyanax</strong>&mdash;Prince of Troy, his wife and son. He is the greatest warrior second to Achilles in the battle at Troy. He kills Patroclus which spurs Achilles to rejoin the battle to kill him.</p>
        <p><strong>Cassandra</strong>&mdash;Daughter of Priam and prophetess doomed never to be believed. She foresaw the fall of Troy but nobody listened to her. She is eventually taken as the concubine of Agamemnon.<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Aeneas</strong>&mdash;Son of Anchises and Aphrodite. He escapes Troy with his father Anchises. He is important in mythology for founding Rome which he does after leaving Troy and sailing to Italy.</p>
        <p><strong>Glaucus and Sarpedon</strong>&mdash;The leaders of the Lycians, allies of Troy. They are both great warriors. Glaucus has a famous meeting with the Greek warrior Diomedes in <em>Iliad</em> book 6. Sarpedon is the son of Zeus, and the greatest Trojan hero after Hector. Sarpedon is killed by Patroclus.</p>
