        <h2 class="title">Oedipus' Blindness&mdash;The Difficulty of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Oedipus lives at Thebes in ignorance for some time, and has two sons, Polynices and Eteocles, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismene, with Jocasta.  However, a plague comes upon Thebes. Oedipus sends Creon to consult the oracle at Delphi which tells him that he must rid the land of a pollution. Oedipus vows to do so, unaware that he is the pollution. The truth is revealed by the death of Oedipus&rsquo; &lsquo;father&rsquo; in Corinth, Polybus. A messenger, the same shepherd to whom Oedipus was given long ago, comes to give the news. He reveals that Oedipus was not the real son of Polybus, and it is discovered that he is the son of Jocasta. When Jocasta realizes this, she hangs herself. Oedipus is a bit slower to understand, but he in turn blinds himself by poking out his eyes with pins.</p>
        <p> The Oedipus myth has been made famous by the psychoanalytical theories of Sigmund Freud, who termed what he saw as an innate desire of young men to sleep with their mothers the Oedipus Complex after this myth. On another level, however, this myth is more about the difficulty of knowledge. The apparently clever Oedipus, who solves the Sphinx&rsquo;s riddle, is ironically at first is unable to see the truth before him, and when he does understand his situation, he takes his physical sight. The various versions of this myth play with this motif of recognition and understanding, especially the most famous account of the myth by Sophocles in his tragedy <em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em>. The myth also reflects upon divine will, expressed to humans through the oracle at Delphi, and the impossibility of avoiding this. Concepts of fate and human freedom are central to various religious and philosophical schools of thought and are questions with which we all must grapple in some way in our lives. The myth of Oedipus helps us to explore such questions, even as it gives no certain answers. </p>
