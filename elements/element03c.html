     <h2 class="title">Prometheus</h2>
     <p>This then is one explanation for the decline of mankind. Created by Kronos, the gods, and then by Zeus alone, mankind starts well, but goes through a series of stages toward what we are now; as one race dies, another is created, but no particular reason is given for the decline in humanity. Another story, told by Hesiod in both his <em>Theogony</em> and in his <em>Works and Days</em> (here an example that alternative traditions can exist in even the same author) gives an explanation for the decline of mankind in the actions of the tricky and clever Prometheus. Prometheus is also a divinity, the son of Iapetus, one of the Titans and the Oceanid Nymph Clymene. Prometheus is in mythology intricately tied with humanity, and although in Hesiod it is Zeus and the other gods who actually created mankind, a later tradition even has Prometheus as the creator of man. The Latin poet Horace has the following to say about Prometheus, <em>Ode</em> 1.16.13 &lsquo;They say that when Prometheus was compelled to add an element cut from every animal to our primordial clay, he also put into the human heart the violence of the lion.&rsquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a> In Hesiod, however, Prometheus is responsible for tricking Zeus and giving humanity the power of fire. The tale of Prometheus is told in both the <em>Theogony </em>and the <em>Works</em> <em>and Days</em>. Prometheus tricks Zeus into taking the bone and the fat as his portion of sacrifice while humans receive the meat (<em>Theogony </em>lines 535-569). It was thought in Greek religion that the gods received a portion of sacrificed animals, and this myth explains why humans take the meat portion to eat themselves while the gods receive the smoke of the burnt fat and bones (humans of course receive the edible part). This then is why Zeus originally becomes angry with mankind, because Prometheus tricked him out of receiving the best portion of sacrifice. As a result of having been tricked, Zeus decides to withhold fire from humanity; but the anger of Zeus over the sacrifice does not dissuade Prometheus from defying him. Prometheus steals fire from Zeus, hides it in a stalk of fennel (used in antiquity to transport fire, as it withstood the heat) and delivers it to mankind. Fire is of course a symbol of technology and the advancement of mankind, just as it is today connected with industry and power.<strong></strong></p>
