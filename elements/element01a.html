     <p>The first question we must ask is, what is mythology?  The English word is actually derived from a Greek word 'mythos' (μῦθος) which we find in Greek literature as far back as Homer in the 8th century B.C.E.. It there means 'word', 'speech', 'tale or story'. In a very broad sense, we might say that the English word has a similar meaning to the original Greek; the word mythology will for many make us think of a story. But such a definition is at best only a partial description of what mythology is. There is, it must be admitted from the outset, no universal definition of mythology. Nonetheless, one can speak meaningfully about the nature of mythology.</p>
<p>One important misconception about mythology is that it is a genre of stories which are entirely false. This is an assumption which must be guarded against as you approach the myths which we will read this semester. At the very simplest of levels, one might begin by saying that many myths, such as the stories of the Trojan war, are very possibly based in some historical reality. Certain elements of Homer's epic poem the <em>Iliad</em> are undoubetly fantastic (the grandeur of the battle scenes, the direct involvement of the gods), yet the story might ultimately have derived from a historical battle at the site of the city Troy in the<a id="various3" href="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m10!1m8!1m3!1d784305.3602255594!2d26.464762!3d39.8363045!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1398099472289"> Troad</a>, located in modern-day north-western Turkey. Furthermore, although we ourselves may doubt the historical reality of events in the Iliad, the Greeks and Romans did not so easily separate history, an account of actual historical events (however much historical narratives, even modern ones, are constructs), from what one reads in Homer's poetry, or in the Aeneid of the Roman poet Virgil. The Aeneid of Virgil is in part an explanation of the foundation of Rome by Aeneas, who travelled to Italy from Troy after it was sacked. Regardless of whether they believed all elements of the story, as we certainly do not today, the Romans did not separate this story entirely from what they perceived to be historical truth. So, while we might in a myth see many fantastic elements, we cannot exclude the possibility that a myth had its origins in historical reality, nor that myths were perceived as containing historical truth by the Greeks and Romans who heard them. There are, for example, even today numerous religions around the world that regard supernatural events as historical, while others see them as unreal. Perceptions of historical truth are inherently subjective.</p>
           <p>On a deeper level as well, we cannot say that even the most fantastical of myths is 'false'. Certainly, when we read of Eros (known in the Roman tradition as Cupid) striking someone with an arrow to cause them to fall in love, we do not take this action as the literal truth; it goes against the empirical understanding of our modern culture, that there should be a small boy who flies around and shoots arrows at us. But when the same myth explains the suffering and joys of love which every human experiences, that myth is speaking of a fundamental truth of human nature, regardless of what fantastical elements may be part of the story. Love, like so many aspects of our human existence, is not entirely quantifiable or understandable through scientific enquiry. In short, mythology can, despite having many elements which we do not consider to be truth, reveal and explore certain absolute truths of human nature and existence. Of course, that mythology is important to us even today is evinced by the fact that myths continue to play important roles in cultures around the world (consider, for example, the myths of films that you watch – do they serve only as entertainment?). </p>
           <p>Myth then, if we wish to define it broadly, is a story which can be told either through words, or as we will see frequently in this course through painting, music, dance, or more modern media such as film or television. It is a story that may contain many fantastical elements. However, it can nonetheless have a connection to historical reality, and, whether it does or not, it can consider and explore universal truths about ourselves and our humanity.</p>
           <p>With this broad definition understood, we can further divide mythology into three main categories which we will use in our consideration of mythology in this course. The first category of myth is Myth proper which is used in modern scholarship to designate those stories which deal primarily with the gods, and the relationship between humans and gods. The Homeric Hymns, of which we will read several this term are good examples of such Myths. The second category Saga/Legend refers to those stories which have more of a connection (at least a perceived connection) to history. An example of this is the Theban saga, in which <a id="various3" href="https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=Thebes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Thebes,+Viotia,+Greece&amp;gl=ca&amp;t=m&amp;z=10&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed">Thebes</a>, a real Greek city, is at the centre of a more human-focused set of stories. A third category of myths we will be looking at is Folktale which includes tales of fantastical adventure of particular heroes: the adventures of Heracles (Hercules) might be classified under this heading. Such categorisation is useful in distinguishing between different types of myth, but it is extremely important to remember that such divisions are not absolute, and many of the myths which we will be looking at in this course will contain elements from both. For example, when we look at Homer's epic poem the Iliad, we will see that it is in many respects a saga, the story of the Greeks fighting against the Trojans, but it is also a story in which the gods and their interactions with humans are very important; such a story has elements of Myth proper as defined above and Saga/Legend. These categories, then, are here to help us in understanding and classifying mythology (and remember that these are categories only of modern scholarship; the Greek and Romans did not categorize their mythology in this way), but it becomes apparent again and again when studying classical mythology that there is no one universal definition of myth which will fit all of the stories which we encounter.</p>
