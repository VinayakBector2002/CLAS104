<h2>Submission Times</h2>
<p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the <strong>Eastern Time Zone</strong> (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time that your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are outside the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance with converting your time, please try the <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>.</p>
<h2>Accommodation Due to Illness</h2>
<p><strong>If your instructor has provided specific procedures for you to follow if you miss assignment due dates, term tests, or a final examination, adhere to those instructions.</strong> Otherwise:</p>
<h3>Missed Assignments/Tests/Quizzes</h3>
<p>Contact the instructor as soon as you realize there will be a problem, and preferably within 48 hours, but no more than 72 hours, have a medical practitioner complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verification of Illness Form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Email</strong> a scanned copy of the Verification of Illness Form to your instructor. In your email to the instructor, provide your name, student ID number, and exactly what course activity you missed.</p>
<p>Further information regarding Management of Requests for Accommodation Due to Illness can be found on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/accommodation-due-to-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accommodation due to illness</a> page.</p>
<h3>Missed Final Examinations</h3>

<p>Further information about Examination&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations" rel="noopener">Accommodations<span class="icons new-tab"></span></a>&nbsp;is available in the Undergraduate Calendar.</p>
<!--h3>Missed Final Examinations</h3>
<p>If this course has a final exam and if you are unable to write a final examination due to illness, seek medical treatment and have a medical practitioner complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic" target="_blank">Verification of Illness Form</a>. Email a scanned copy to the Centre for Extended Learning (CEL) at <a href="mailto:extendedlearning@uwaterloo.ca?body=Name: %0D%0AUser ID: %0D%0ACourse:">extendedlearning@uwaterloo.ca</a> within 48 hours of your missed exam.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. <strong>If you have not already completed the online tutorial regarding academic integrity you should do so as soon as possible. </strong>Undergraduate students should see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/get-assignment-and-research-help/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Integrity Tutorial</a> and graduate students should see the&nbsp;<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/get-assignment-and-research-help/academic-integrity/graduate-students-and-academic-integrity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graduate Students and Academic Integrity</a> website.</p>
<p>Proper citations are part of academic integrity. Citations in CEL course materials usually follow CEL style, which is based on APA style. Your course may follow a different style. If you are uncertain which style to use for an assignment, please confirm with your instructor or TA.</p>
<p>For further information on academic integrity, please visit the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
<h2>Turnitin</h2>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com</strong>: Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students’ submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin® in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit the alternate assignment.</p>

<h2>Discipline</h2>
<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academic integrity</a>&nbsp;to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration, should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check&nbsp;<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances</a>, (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>, may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy 72 - Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<h2>Grievance</h2>
<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances</a>, Section 4. When in doubt please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

Students must go to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quest</a> to see all final grades. Any grades posted in Waterloo LEARN are unofficial.</p>
<h2>AccessAbility Services</h2>
<p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.
