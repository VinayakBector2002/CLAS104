<p>Here is an example of a good (although abbreviated) post on the question, &lsquo;Is Apollo a just god?&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any consideration of whether or not Apollo is a just god must engage ultimately with the question of how justice was viewed in antiquity, in particular how justice is to be understood in ancient Greek and Roman mythology. One might justifiably say that our modern Canadian understanding of justice does not apply to the Greek and Roman gods. This question aside, we can perhaps discern a sense of right and wrong in the myths of the god. Apollo can, at times, be seen to act in vengeance and anger, as in the myth of Niobe and her children, but he can also, in some versions of the myths told about him, regret his actions and have pity for those he has hurt. His pity can be seen clearly in the myth of Coronis, Apollo&rsquo;s lover, whom he shoots with an arrow, an action he immediately regrets. Alexandra said in an earlier post that Apollo was ruthless. This is a fair comment in some respects, but the myth of Coronis just mentioned shows that he is not always like this&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example of a bad post on the same question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apollo was a real good god and did a lot of cool stuff. What Eddy said in an earlier post about him being mean is total crap &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think Eddy knows what the hell he&rsquo;s talking about, frankly. I mean, Apollo has arrows and a bow, but I don&rsquo;t remember any crazy warfare anywheres that would give people there idea about him being totally terrible&hellip;&hellip;</p>
